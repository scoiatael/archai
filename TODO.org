#+TITLE: Todo
I'd consider this to be post-1.0.0, since it's been used in production for a couple of years fairly modern deployments (> 10k datapoints per second). Sadly most of the codebase has been in private hands, so I'm coming back to this one.
* 2.0.0
** TODO Remove ~iris~ in favor of ~fasthttprouter~
** TODO Support writing data points to default epoch (e.g. ISO week)
** TODO Support "files" persistence
** TODO CI/CD
* 2.1.0
** TODO Clean up Cassandra migrations
